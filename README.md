# TimeDomainTHz
THz radiation propagation in time-domain

THz fields are described as time traces of (E,B) vector fields
arranged in a (rectangular) grid. For propagation the Kirchhoff integral
is evaluated directly.

This feature branch implements individual timing for then traces
comprising one dataset (screen). This enables a great reduction
in neccesary storage for screesn angled with respect to
the direction of propagation.
